Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
app = Flask(__name__) is similar to Python, Java, and other languages where a variable's value is set to an output of a function. In this case, __name__ is the input or argument of the function Flask and the variable name is app. Flask(__name__) also looks like a constructor so app could be an instance of the object Flask.

Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
In the terminal, '/' is used to show a path for a file. It is used to separate folders in a path. Using '/' may signify that a path is going into a subfolder. Since this is just '/' without any folder names, this might route the app to the route directory. '/' is also used in the urls of websites to separate subdirectories, and a single '/' may indicate the home directory.
- After running app.py, I think that @app.route("/") tells the Flask app where Flask is installed so that the file can run.
- I think that the "/" in the route method for app indicates a default route, where changing the parameter would alter the route that is taken.

Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
The input __name__ will print in the terminal.
- __main__ is actually printed in the terminal.

Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
"No hablo queso!" will not appear anywhere because the function hello_world() isn't being called anywhere so "No hablo queso!" isn't being directly printed.
- "No hablo queso!" actually appears on the webpage at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
    - app.route("/") may have caused the command to be routed towards the "/" or the default directory of the domain.
    - after changing app.route("/") to app.route("/test"), the text appears on "http://127.0.0.1:5000/test" and "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" returns on error.

Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
In other languages like Java that uses OOP, app.run() is similar to calling a method of an object.

Observations:
- Installing Flask: "WARNING: You are using pip version 20.2.3; however, version 21.2.4 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the '/Users/apple/KC/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip' command."
- Running app.py:
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
__main__
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2021 10:51:01] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2021 10:51:01] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
__main__
127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2021 10:53:40] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -

- The time that the website is loaded on appears in the lines above.
- Everytime the url is loaded, another line like the ones above appears in the terminal.
    - If the subdirectory of the url is changed, say to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/test", this line appears:
    127.0.0.1 - - [03/Oct/2021 16:45:13] "GET /test HTTP/1.1" 404 -
        - This generates a 404 error, which is in the terminal and on the website.
 - The website cannot be loaded anymore after you quit the app.
