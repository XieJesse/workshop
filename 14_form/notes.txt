K14 -- Form and Function

*What does echo mean? to print what the user inputted
**What is a request method? The 'Get' and 'Post' methods
***Is pressing the submit button on the form the same as pressing enter on the keyboard? If so, is there any purpose in having a submit input button?

Predictions:
-When you're in default page of website ("/"), terminal prints out...
  -app Flask object, request, the arguments of request, and the header of request
  -request is just another module of Flask (like render_template)
  - "Waaaa hooo...." is printed in webpage

  *In authenticate, the requests won't be asked because there's no render_template(<template>)

Observations:
-In the terminal, information including the name of the flask object, the website that is opened, any arguments, and "heading information" is printed
  -In the default page of the website that is accessed, there are no arguments in the arguments dictionary printed in the terminal
  -The input of the form becomes a variable called 'username' as put in login.html
-There was only 1 input box when we ran the "/" page - but there are two input <> in HTML file
  -Removing second input line in HTML file removes the "Submit Query" button!! (can still submit using /enter/)
  -If you click on "Submit Query" --> user is brought to /auth page (with the variables containing the arguments being present in the url)
  -Why? Because <form action="/auth"> makes the form perform this action when the code inside <form> </form> is executed
-Removing the ""&sub1=Submit" from the url removes ('sub1', 'Submit') from the dictionary
  -Changing the arguments put in the url directly changes the data in the dictionary as seen in the terminal

-We realized that the username inputted would be stored in request. So we used request.args['username'] to get it. 
-It seems that for forms, the default method is "get"
-Then, when rendering the template, we set method=request.method (which tells us the method used, "get" or "post") and username=username
-We also wanted to have some fun with some ASCII art related to our team name, and after fiddling around a bit, we figured out that <pre> keeps the spaces in the art.
