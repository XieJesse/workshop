About Code:
- <ul> was used to make a bullet point list, with <li> defining a new point.
- <style> was used to edit how the table looked, so that the data was formatted
well enough.
- <table> was used to make a table with <tr> to declare a new row in the table,
as well as <th> and <td> to define headings and normal text in tables respectively.

EGO:
- This heavily applies to our class where we work in groups of three and look at
the code of our peers very frequently. We rotate groups so that we can have
different perspectives looking at code and exchange newer ideas amongst newer
minds.
- Rotating groups on the same project lets everyone get a grasp on the general
collection of ideas in the code of the project. I think that not many people
have fallen behind in comprehending the work, and even if they have, they catch
up very quickly with their groups.
