* .addEventListener(event, function() { body; } );
  Calls function without the event occurring when you refer to fxnName
 * All HTML code should be places before the script tag that links the JS file
 * We know that element.appendChild() can be used on body, div, block, and lists tags
 * To appendChild and add something to the HTML, we have to first
 createElement("tag name"), edit its innerHTML, and setAttribute if desired before appending
 * appendchild() can append directly to the body of the html by using document.body
