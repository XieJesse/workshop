* .addEventListener(event, function() { body; } );
  Calls function without the event occurring when you refer to fxnName()
	- ACTUALLY, it works when you only write fxnName without the parenthesis if there are
	  no parameters
* All HTML code should be places before the script tag that links the JS file
	- Must link JS at the end of the HTML file
* We know that element.appendChild() can be used on body, div, block, and lists tags
	- appendchild() can append directly to the body of the html by using document.body
* To appendChild and add something to the HTML, we have to first
createElement("tag name"), edit its innerHTML, and setAttribute if desired
* When accessing a list item, is there a way to only get the text without the HTML tag?
