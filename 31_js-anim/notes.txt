K31 -- canvas based JS animation
2022-02-16
HTML file for JavaScript canvas work


requestID starts at approximately 1 and increases by 1 every frame
window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID)
- requires a requestID to also be updated
requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame(callback)
- this works to also prevent acceleration
- parentheses after callback will make it not work
-- ex: drawDot() is not going to work
